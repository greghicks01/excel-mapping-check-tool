# Excel Map to Source Tool
This tool is based on some work i have done for a commercial data engine.

A dicussion revealed soruce data headings have been imported with inappropriate characters and lengths. This tool is intended to provide a frontloading step to manage the bad characters for the headers and identify data that can't be loaded.

## Motivation
I developed this tool in my spare time, which gave the team a faster method to review and correct the input data
